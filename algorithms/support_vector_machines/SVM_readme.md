## Introduction

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find a hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space. This project implements SVMs for classification tasks with examples, code, and analysis.

## Theory and Concepts

- **Key Features of SVM**:
  - Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
  - Maximizes the margin between data points and the hyperplane.
  - Supports linear and non-linear classification using kernel tricks.

- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  - Objective: Minimize `1/2 ||w||^2` subject to the constraints:
    ```
    yi(w Â· xi + b) >= 1 for all i
    ```
  - Kernel functions: Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), Sigmoid.

## Repository Structure

- **Data**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive examples for SVM basics and advanced topics.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the SVM model.
- **Models**: Saved SVM models for quick deployment.
