# 1. Dimension Reduction

### What it is:

Dimension reduction refers to techniques used to reduce the number of features in a dataset. The goal is to simplify the complexity of the dataset while retaining as much information as possible, thereby improving model performance or computational efficiency.

**Why itâ€™s needed:**
- Curse of dimensionality: When the dimensionality is too high, distance metrics become less effective, and models are prone to overfitting.
- Noise reduction: It helps remove redundant or irrelevant features.
- Visualization: Lower-dimensional data is easier to visualize (e.g., reducing to 2D or 3D).

**Common methods:**
1.	Feature selection: Selecting the most relevant features that significantly impact the target variable.
	
- 	Methods: Variance threshold, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), model-based selection, etc.
2.	Feature extraction: Transforming original features into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much information as possible.
- Methods:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Finds directions of maximum variance through linear transformation.
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Considers class labels to maximize inter-class distance and minimize intra-class distance.
- t-SNE and UMAP: Non-linear dimension reduction techniques better suited for data visualization.
